Cecille's N'Style — Manuscript Summary

Overview
- Project: "Cecille's N'Style Boutique Management System" — a retail management system for a small clothing boutique in Davao City.
- Purpose: Replace the current semi-manual, paper-based processes with a centralized system to manage sales, inventory, employees/payroll, suppliers, and reporting.
- Scope: Point-of-sale, inventory tracking (stock-ins/stock-outs/returns), customer/supplier records, employee attendance and payroll calculations, basic analytics/reports, and administrative interfaces.

Primary Actors
- Store Owner / Manager (Admin)
- Sales Clerk (POS user)
- Supplier (external entity recorded in system)
- Customer (recorded for orders/loyalty)

Key Problems Identified
- No centralized record system (customers, employees, products).
- Inventory movement not tracked systematically (leading to inaccuracies).
- Payroll computed manually (attendance, deductions, advances not automated).
- Sales and supplier transactions not recorded electronically (traceability, profitability missing).
- Lack of analytics and automated reports for decision-making.

Functional Requirements (high level)
1. Authentication & Authorization
   - Admin and clerk roles, secure login.
2. Product & Inventory Management
   - CRUD for products, categories, sizing/variants.
   - Record stock-ins, stock-outs, returns, damaged goods.
   - Real-time stock level checks and alerts for low stock.
3. Sales / POS
   - Create sales transactions, support multiple payment methods.
   - Generate receipts and persist sales records with timestamps, clerk, items, totals.
4. Customer & Supplier Management
   - Store customer contact and order history; record supplier details and purchase orders.
5. Employee & Payroll Management
   - Employee records, attendance logging, automated payroll calculations (hours, deductions, advances).
6. Reporting & Analytics
   - Daily/weekly/monthly sales reports, inventory valuation, payroll summaries, supplier purchase logs.
7. Data Import / Initialization
   - Schema and seed data loader (use `sia.sql` for DB initialization).

Non-Functional Requirements
- Use MySQL (existing choice in repo) via connection pool for concurrent access.
- Simple, responsive frontend (Vite + React already present).
- Local-first deployment for small-shop environment; support small-scale concurrency.
- Basic logging and error handling; secure storage of credentials (use `.env`, ignore in git).

Suggested Data Model (entities)
- Product (id, sku, name, category, price, cost, stock_qty, size, color, notes)
- InventoryTransaction (id, product_id, type[in/out/return/damage], qty, date, reference)
- Sale (id, date, total, payment_method, clerk_id, customer_id)
- SaleItem (sale_id, product_id, qty, unit_price)
- Employee (id, name, role, contact, pay_rate)
- Attendance (employee_id, date, clock_in, clock_out, hours)
- Payroll (employee_id, period_start, period_end, gross_pay, deductions, net_pay)
- Supplier (id, name, contact, address)
- Customer (id, name, contact, notes)

API / Endpoints (examples)
- GET /health/db
- POST /auth/login
- GET /products, POST /products, PUT /products/:id
- GET /inventory, POST /inventory/transaction
- POST /sales, GET /sales/:id
- GET /employees, POST /employees
- GET /reports/sales?start=&end=

Assessment of current repo (short)
- Backend: Minimal Express server with `/` and `/health/db`; DB pool in `backend/src/database/database.js` uses env vars. `backend/src/database/sia.sql` provides schema. Remove hard-coded defaults in DB code; add `backend/.env.example`.
- Frontend: Vite + React ready; `axios` and `react-router-dom` installed. `src/api/api.js` is empty — create axios client and wire `BrowserRouter` in `src/main.js`. `App.js` is placeholder.

Immediate Next Steps (recommended)
1. Create `backend/.env.example` and secure real `.env` locally.
2. Harden `database.js` to require env vars in production and avoid insecure defaults.
3. Implement basic axios client in `frontend/src/api/api.js` with `VITE_API_BASE` or similar.
4. Wrap `App` with `BrowserRouter`; add routes for Dashboard, POS, Inventory, Employees, Reports.
5. Implement backend CRUD endpoints for Products, InventoryTransactions, Sales, Employees.
6. Load `sia.sql` to initialize the database and run integration tests against local DB.

Files I created/updated
- `manuscript.txt` (extracted full text)
- `system_overview.txt` (project assessment)
- `manuscript_summary.txt` (this summary)

If you want, I can now:
- Implement the `axios` client and basic route scaffolding in the frontend, or
- Harden `database.js` and add `backend/.env.example`, or
- Scaffold the main backend APIs and sample DB seed execution script.

Which of these should I pick next?
