Introduction
 
 
1.1.
 
The
 
Organization
 
 
The
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
organization
 
chosen
 
for
 
this
 
study
 
is
 
Cecille’ s
 
N’
 
Style
 
Boutique,
 
a
 
small
 
retail
 
clothing
 
store
 
located
 
in
 
Davao
 
City.
 
The
 
representative
 
and
 
owner
 
of
 
the
 
business
 
is
 
Cecille
 
B.
 
Ilanga,
 
who
 
oversees
 
daily
 
operations
 
including
 
sales,
 
employee
 
management,
 
and
 
supplier
 
coordination.
 
The
 
boutique
 
specializes
 
in
 
trendy
 
apparel
 
and
 
accessories
 
for
 
men
 
and
 
women,
 
catering
 
primarily
 
to
 
walk-in
 
customers
 
within
 
the
 
local
 
area.
 
 
1.2.
 
Organization
 
Brief
 
Description
 
 
Cecille’ s
 
N’
 
Style
 
Boutique
 
operates
 
within
 
the
 
retail
 
fashion
 
industry ,
 
focusing
 
on
 
clothing
 
and
 
fashion
 
accessories.
 
The
 
store
 
caters
 
to
 
both
 
walk-in
 
customers
 
and
 
occasional
 
bulk
 
orders
 
from
 
loyal
 
clients.
 
The
 
organizational
 
structure
 
is
 
simple
 
—
 
with
 
the
 
Store
 
Owner/Manager
 
at
 
the
 
top,
 
followed
 
by
 
a
 
small
 
staff
 
of
 
sales
 
clerks
 
who
 
manage
 
customer
 
orders
 
and
 
handle
 
transactions.
 
The
 
store
 
manager
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
supervising
 
operations,
 
managing
 
inventory ,
 
monitoring
 
employee
 
attendance,
 
and
 
overseeing
 
financial
 
reports.
 
The
 
sales
 
clerks,
 
on
 
the
 
other
 
hand,
 
assist
 
customers
 
with
 
product
 
inquiries,
 
record
 
sales
 
transactions,
 
and
 
update
 
order
 
information.
 
The
 
boutique
 
started
 
as
 
a
 
small
 
clothing
 
stall
 
and
 
has
 
since
 
expanded
 
into
 
a
 
full
 
boutique,
 
although
 
operations
 
remain
 
primarily
 
manual.
 
 
1.3.
 
Current
 
Business
 
Process
 
At
 
present,
 
Cecille’ s
 
N’
 
Style
 
Boutique
 
operates
 
with
 
a
 
semi-manual
 
workflow
 
that
 
relies
 
heavily
 
on
 
paper
 
records
 
and
 
handwritten
 
documentation.
 
The
 
following
 
summarizes
 
their
 
current
 
processes:
 
Sales
 
and
 
Ordering
 
-
 
Customers
 
select
 
items
 
for
 
purchase
 
with
 
assistance
 
from
 
sales
 
clerks.
 
The
 
sales
 
clerks
 
manually
 
compute
 
prices,
 
record
 
sales
 
on
 
paper
 
receipts,
 
and
 
update
 
the
 
owner
 
verbally
 
regarding
 
daily
 
sales.
 
Inventory
 
Management
 
-
 
Stock
 
monitoring
 
is
 
done
 
manually
 
by
 
checking
 
physical
 
stock
 
levels.
 
Replenishment
 
orders
 
are
 
made
 
only
 
when
 
the
 
owner
 
notices
 
shortages.
 
No
 
formal
 
system
 
tracks
 
stock-ins,
 
stock-outs,
 
returns,
 
or
 
damaged
 
items.
 

 
Human
 
Resource
 
(HR)
 
and
 
Payroll
 
-
 
Employee
 
records
 
are
 
stored
 
in
 
paper
 
format,
 
listing
 
basic
 
details
 
such
 
as
 
names,
 
contact
 
numbers,
 
and
 
assigned
 
roles.
 
Payroll
 
computations
 
are
 
done
 
manually
 
by
 
the
 
owner ,
 
often
 
using
 
estimated
 
working
 
hours
 
without
 
automated
 
calculation
 
of
 
deductions
 
or
 
cash
 
advances.
 
 
 
 
1.4.
 
Identified
 
Problems
 
 
 
Based
 
on
 
observation
 
and
 
interviews
 
with
 
the
 
store
 
owner ,
 
several
 
operational
 
problems
 
were
 
identified:
 
1.
 
Lack
 
of
 
a
 
centralized
 
record
 
system
 
–
 
Employee,
 
customer ,
 
and
 
product
 
records
 
are
 
kept
 
manually ,
 
leading
 
to
 
inconsistencies
 
and
 
delays
 
in
 
retrieval.
 
2.
 
Unmonitored
 
inventory
 
movement
 
–
 
Stock-ins
 
and
 
stock-outs
 
are
 
not
 
systematically
 
tracked,
 
leading
 
to
 
inaccurate
 
inventory
 
counts.
 
3.
 
Manual
 
payroll
 
computation
 
–
 
Employee
 
attendance,
 
deductions,
 
and
 
cash
 
advances
 
are
 
not
 
integrated
 
into
 
a
 
payroll
 
system,
 
causing
 
frequent
 
errors.
 
4.
 
No
 
sales
 
or
 
supplier
 
tracking
 
system
 
–
 
Sales
 
are
 
written
 
on
 
paper
 
and
 
supplier
 
transactions
 
are
 
not
 
recorded,
 
making
 
it
 
difficult
 
to
 
trace
 
orders
 
or
 
calculate
 
profitability .
 
5.
 
Lack
 
of
 
data
 
analytics
 
–
 
The
 
absence
 
of
 
automated
 
reports
 
makes
 
it
 
hard
 
for
 
management
 
to
 
make
 
informed
 
decisions
 
on
 
sales,
 
staffing,
 
or
 
restocking.
 
 
2.
 
Proposed
 
System
 
The
 
proposed
 
system,
 
Cecille’ s
 
N’
 
Style
 
Boutique
 
Management
 
System,
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
automate
 
and
 
streamline
 
key
 
operations
 
within
 
the
 
boutique
 
including
 
Human
 
Resource
 
(HR),
 
Payroll,
 
Inventory ,
 
Sales
 
Ordering,
 
and
 
Supplier
 
Ordering
 
modules.
 
Each
 
subsystem
 
will
 
handle
 
specific
 
organizational
 
functions
 
but
 
remain
 
interconnected
 
through
 
a
 
shared
 
database.

2.2
 
 
Use
 
Case
 
List
 
 
This
 
proposed
 
study
 
focuses
 
on
 
the
 
management
 
and
 
operations
 
of
 
Cecille’s
 
Nstyle
 
Boutique,
 
specifically
 
addressing
 
the
 
challenges
 
in
 
tracking
 
and
 
maintaining
 
its
 
inventory
 
of
 
clothing
 
and
 
accessories.
 
The
 
system
 
aims
 
to
 
provide
 
accurate
 
monitoring
 
of
 
available
 
stocks
 
and
 
ensure
 
that
 
restocking
 
activities
 
are
 
well-documented
 
to
 
avoid
 
shortages
 
or
 
overstocking.
 
This
 
study
 
also
 
includes
 
the
 
processes
 
of
 
employee
 
attendance
 
and
 
payroll
 
management.
 
It
 
integrates
 
employee
 
records
 
with
 
payroll
 
computations,
 
automating
 
salary
 
calculations
 
based
 
on
 
attendance,
 
leaves,
 
overtime,
 
and
 
other
 
deductions.
 
This
 
reduces
 
manual
 
errors
 
and
 
ensures
 
accurate
 
and
 
timely
 
compensation
 
for
 
staff.
 
Furthermore,
 
the
 
study
 
covers
 
the
 
organization’s
 
sales
 
and
 
ordering
 
processes
 
within
 
the
 
boutique.
 
It
 
replaces
 
traditional
 
paper-based
 
methods
 
with
 
a
 
more
 
efficient,
 
computerized
 
system
 
that
 
manages
 
customer
 
transactions,
 
product
 
pricing,
 
order
 
finalization,
 
and
 
receipt
 
generation.
 
This
 
ensures
 
faster
 
service,
 
better
 
transaction
 
tracking,
 
and
 
improved
 
customer
 
satisfaction.
 
This
 
proposed
 
system
 
covers
 
the
 
following
 
business
 
areas:
